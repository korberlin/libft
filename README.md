Hey there! Welcome to my Libft project! 🚀 As a student at 42 Berlin, I took on this challenge to delve deep into the world of C programming. Libft isn't just any project; it's my first step towards mastering the language and understanding the inner workings of standard C library functions.

## About
Libft isn't just a bunch of functions; it's a journey of discovery. In this project, I've recreated essential C standard library functions alongside some nifty utility functions that'll be my trusty companions throughout my time at 42 Berlin.

## Usage
To get started with Libft, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory.
3. Compile the `libft.a` library by running `make`.
4. Link `libft.a` to your projects and include the header file `libft.h` in your source files.
5. Voila! You're all set to harness the power of Libft in your projects.
